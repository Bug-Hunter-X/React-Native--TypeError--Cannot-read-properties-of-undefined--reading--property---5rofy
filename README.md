# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')` error. This error occurs when you attempt to access a property of an object that is currently null or undefined.

The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces this error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that handles the potential for null or undefined values.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the app.

You should see the error in the console. Then, switch to `bugSolution.js` to see the fix in action.
